Notes on section in introduction on colation vs digitally distributed meetings

While we believe our work can be applied in many different circumstances, within
this paper, we principally focus on the use-case of co-located participants. This
is done so that we can stick with singular, common-sense definitions of what an
agent might perceive, point at, etc, especially in conjunction with how it affects
other agents. As shown in ~\cite{greenberg_implications_2016}, a move to digitially
distributed environments have an acute effect upon participants and their understanding
of each other. Principally, it becomes harder for agents to fully understand the
physicality of other agents, and as such it becomes harder for agents to "point out"
content to each other. Additionally, it is hard for agents to understand where another
agent's focus may be, versus when co-located. Through this, we stick to co-located
participants, and which drives our formalizations, and look to future work to tackle
the case of distributed participants.
