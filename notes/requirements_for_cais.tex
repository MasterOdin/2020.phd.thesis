In this section, we present our requirements that a Cognitive and Immersive System must follow. 
These requirements
This
set of requirements, $L$, 

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{C}$ \emph{Cognitive}: A CAIS should be able to
      help agents with cognitive tasks and goals.  For instance, a
      system that simply aids in querying a domain $D$ is not
      cognitive in nature; a system that aids an agent in convincing
      another agent that some state-of-affairs holds in $D$ is
      considered cognitive. (Please see the appendix for more
      discussion of our usage of the term ``cognitive.'')
    \item $\mathcal{I}$ \emph{Immersive}:  There should
      be some attribute or property of a CAIS that is non-localized
      and distinguished from agents in the room.  Moreover, this
      property should be \textbf{common knowledge}.  (Note: this is
      not easily achievable with a physical robot, and this condition
      differentiates a CAIS from a cognitive
      agent.)\footnote{This condition may not strictly be realizable,
        but the goal is to at a minimum build systems that approach
        this ideal condition.}
\end{itemize}
