[1] These two components are principal novel work for the system, and that each have a paper written for its usage, with a proposed
    paper on combination of the two for more complex use cases. Reagent is the component that lets us know what is being displayed
    when showing arbitrary content and MUIFOLD is a cell-phone based interface for interacting with large scale environments, as well
    as for allowing multiple users to interact with screen content concurrently. As such, having these be sub-sub-chapters not great
    as description of the developed techonlogy may stretch a number of pages versus the other components, and so could split into
    its own chapter.
