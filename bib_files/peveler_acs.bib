	abstract = {Humans working in teams typically use task-based natural language dialogues to coordinate activities. And they use mental models of team mates which they update automatically based on perceived and communicated information to predict the actions of their team mates. It is thus reasonable to assume that humans will expect future robots interacting with humans in natural language as part of mixed-initiative teams to exhibit the same kinds of belief modeling exhibited by humans. In this paper, we propose principles that robots can use to represent beliefs and goals of other agents based on task-based natural language dialogues and use automatic inference based on communicated information to update their mental models of other agents. We demonstrate the proposed principles in a simple case study involving two robots and a human operator performing simple tasks in a laboratory environment.},
