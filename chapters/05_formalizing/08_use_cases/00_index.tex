\section{Formalizing Sample Use-Cases of Our CAIS}\label{chap:use_cases}

In this section, we introduce two use-cases for our CAIS to help demonstrate
its capabilities in the realm of planning and plan recognition. For each
use case, we first present it in plain, informal discussion, and follow it
with a formalization within the \CEC. For both use-cases, we utilize a generic
Reagent parser wherein that each element shown is contained in a div that
contains an id attribute which corresponds to the element name in the \CEC\
and that any extra dataset attributes are surfaced then as appropriate axioms.
We do not explore here necessarily how one might formalize other web content,
though work done by Fern{\'a}ndez-Villamor et 
al.~\cite{fernandez-villamor_firstorder_2012} is promising on that front. For
the information presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:reagent}, one might utilize
techniques of parsing ontologies into first-order logic~\cite{pease_english_2003}.
