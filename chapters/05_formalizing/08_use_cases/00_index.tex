\section{Formalizing Sample Use-Cases of our CAIS}\label{chap:use_cases}

In this section, we introduce two use-cases for our CAIS to help demonstrate
its capabilities in the realm of planning and plan recognition. For each
use case, we first present it in plain, informal discussion, and follow it
with a formalization within the \CEC. For both use-cases, for information that
is displayed on the global screen, we utilize a custom Reagent plugin for
being able to understand what is being shown to users.
