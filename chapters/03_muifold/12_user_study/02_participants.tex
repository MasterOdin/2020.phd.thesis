\subsection{Participants}

9 participants were recruited for the experiment from the IBM Brasil lab. There
were 6 males and 3 females. 5 had prior experience with wiimotes, which is an
absolute pointing device that utilizes a sensor with some minor calibration. All
9 had experience using bluetooth and laser pointers, which use relative pointing,
but require no sensor, similar to our approach. 6 of the participants used
phones with Android 7+ on it, while 3 used iPhones using iOS 11+.
