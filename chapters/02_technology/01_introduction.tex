\section{Introduction}

In this chapter, we introduce the vision of what would constitute a cognitive
and immersive system, followed with a real-world implementation of various
components. As discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:introduction}, we expect that
while a CAIS may be deployed into a variety of environments of differing
capabilities, they will all follow a similiar overarching structure of how
they are laid out, show in Figure~\ref{fig:cais_high_level}
