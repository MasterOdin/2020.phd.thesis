\subsection{Speaker Worker}

The speaker-worker is responsible for receiving a text sentence and then outputting on the
system's speakers. It utilizes the Watson Text-to-Speech service to do this. As part of its
input, it expects the language of the received sentence as well as a voice to use for its
output. For each supported language, there is minimally a male and female voice that can
be used, with some languages supporting additional more natural sounding voices that can
be used. This allows for some slight variation of where the system can take on 2+ roles
of the environment, such as an overarching system moderator, as well as a specific
functional avatar for a usecase. Within the module, there is support of setting the volume
for the output of the module, but it is recommended that users utilize the physical volume
dial of their speakers or the volume manager within their OS for better compatibility and
finer volume control and support.
