\subsection{Knowledge Base}

Our CAIS utilizes a simple knowledge base store to hold information about the system and its participants.
The information is in the form of fluents which are formalized under the \CEC\, which will be discussed
in Chapter~\ref{chap:formalizing}. Each participant that has been registered to the system is tracked
individually with their own set of fluents. Communication to the module happens both through listening to RabbitMQ for adding information to the knowledge base, as well as exposing a REST API for pulling information
out.
