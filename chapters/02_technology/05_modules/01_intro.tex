In this section, we describe a real-world implementation of a CAIS that follows the principles
defined above. We briefly describe each component in the pipeline, giving both the expected
input into it, as well as the expected output. Two components, MUIFOLD and Reagent, are described
in detail in the following chapters, and are omitted here.
