\subsection{executor}

The executor is a relatively simple component where it receives a full command,
and then executes it pertaining to the defined usecase. The action is defined purely
by an application developer, and that there is no ``action discoverability'' within
the system at this time. A result of an action may be displaying content on the
display-worker, outputting speech to the speaker-worker, or making calls to external
services. To determine if an incoming action is valid, it makes a call to our planner
which determines if the action exists and that all pieces are filled-in, as well as that
any pre-conditions for that action are satisfied. The result of that call is any
post-conditions that are set within the environment. These steps are further defined
and formalized in the following chapters.
