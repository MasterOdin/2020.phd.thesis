\subsection{conversation-worker}

The conversation-worker is responsible for taking in a sentence, usually from the transcript-worker
and converting into an tuple of intent and entities. The intent is a singular action while the entities
are a list of elements that can go into this intent.

For our implementation of this component, we utilize the Watson Assistant service. Within this service,
we define intents, and then provide example sentences that would fit that intent to train the system.
This has the benefit of allowing the system the capacity to handle slightly differently worded sentences
than what we might expect, as well as gloss over spelling and grammatical errors that arise from the
transcription process. For entities, we may utilize built-in system ones (such as numbers), or define
our ones, where entities are largely detected through simple pattern matching.
