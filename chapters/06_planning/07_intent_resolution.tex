\section{Intent Resolution}

Given our definitions, we may now attack the problem of intent resolution for our CAIS.
Ideally, any action carried out by our humans within the room would be as explicit
as possible. Indeed, when using something like MUIFOLD, this explicitness is handled for
the user under the hood by the app, tying together what note or block they're interacting
with, and what action they're attempting to accomplish with it. However, through voice,
providing the full explicit action may be difficult or impossible. For example, within
our sticky notes domain, we may expect a user to utter "Delete the green note" or "Change
his note to blue". In the both examples, the exact note ID to be operated on is not given,
and must be resolved by the system if possible by the context of the sentence, and of the
known mental states of agents.
