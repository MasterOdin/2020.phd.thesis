\section{Introduction}

Within these cognitive and immersive systems, it remains paramount that
our overseeing AI is capable of providing assistance to the participating
agents. As agents operate in the room, they are usually operating in pursuit
of a goal, committing actions to get them closer to accomplishing it. For
the over-seeing agent to increase in power, the system must be able to help
the user along their plans. To accomplish this, the system utilizes ``plan
recognition'', wherein given partial observations of actions, and knowledge
of possible goals, it infers the plans of its agents.
