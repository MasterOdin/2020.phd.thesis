\subsection{Hardware and Software}

The setup for the experiment used a 1st generation 84" Microsoft Surface Hub. On
the display, we full-screened a Chrome window that displayed the test. The screen
had a resolution of 3840px by 2160px. Particiapnts stood 3m from the center
of the screen. The server powering the application which
both the Surface Hub and user's cellphones connected had an average ping to both
of around 110ms. For both the Surface Hub and cellphones, the application was
navigated to within the web browser, where interactions were recorded in
real time, and communication handled via a duplex WebSocket connection on all
clients. For the experiment, participants utilized their own phones with no
additional software or browsers installed that they had to use, helping to ensure
generalizability of the approach.
