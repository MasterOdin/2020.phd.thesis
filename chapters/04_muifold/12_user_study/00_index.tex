\section{User Study}

To determine the general effectiveness of our approach and that cellphones
would act as reliable pointing devices, we conducted a preliminary experiment.
Due to the nature of the experiment, we principally focused on qualatitive
feedback from the participants over fully instrumenting out the experiment for
a range of measurements. \footnote{While a longer experiment with additional 
participants was planned, it was scrapped due to the COVID-19 lockdowns.}
For the experiment, we invited in members of IBM Brasil lab to use their phones 
to complete a test which utilized a variation of the Fitts' reciprocal tapping 
test~\cite{fitts_information_1954} and Liu et al.'s grid 
test~\cite{liu_effects_2014}.The hypothesis to be tested was that with minimal 
instruction, users would easily figure out the interface, and to complete the 
task quickly and efficiently.
