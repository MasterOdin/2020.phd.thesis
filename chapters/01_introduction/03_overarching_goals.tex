\section{Overarching Goals}\label{ref:overarching_goals}

Independent of the specific formalisms and technology
that we bring to bear, we need to
model the mental states of humans in order to engineer AI
systems that understand and interact well with them.
For example, work in human-robot teaming has focused on
the use of planning techniques that take human goals and
mental states into account~\cite{briggs_multi-modal_2012}.
In addition, work on human-aware task planning for mobile robots
\cite{cirillo_human-aware_2009} has used \emph{predicted} plans of humans to
guide the system's own planning.
\cite{talamadupula_coordination_2014,chakraborti_planning_2015} showed this
approach more explicitly, representing and reasoning over a subset
of the humans' mental states relevant to the autonomous system's planning
problems.
Recent work has adapted these ideas to proactive decision making
\cite{sengupta_radar_2017,kim_towards_2017} and smart-room environments
\cite{chakraborti_mr._2017}.  \cite{pearce_etal_social_planning_aaai2014}
note the importance of what they call ``social planning,'' which
includes an agent achieving a goal via the modification of the mental
states of others.\footnote{Our example here is briefly returned
to later in ``Prior/Related Work and Novelty.''}

While these papers confirm the importance of formalizing and reasoning
about mental states, they seem to us to lack the formal and
computational machinery needed to mechanize a full human-level theory
of mind --- let alone such a theory of mind \emph{and} the
requirements of a CAIS that we set out below.\footnote{Note that in
  the present paper there is a limit to the theory-of-mind-modeling
  ``power'' we insist an overseeing AI have.  E.g., we don't require
  that an AI overseeing an environment populated with humans have
  so-called \textit{phenomenal consciousness}, a form of ``what's it's
  like to'' consciousness characterized by \cite{bbs.block}, and
  claimed by \cite{sb_billion_conscious_robot}, to be impossible for a
  mere machine to possess.  In sharp contrast with phenomenal
  consciousness, \textit{cognitive consciousness} consists only in the
  logico-mathematical \emph{structure} of human-level (and, indeed,
  above) cognition, instantiated through time.  While cognitive
  consciousness can be characterized axiomatically with help from the
  formal languages we introduce below for cognitive calculi
  \cite{axiomatizing_consciousness1}, in the present paper we do not
  require the AI overseeing a CAIS have even cognitive consciousness,
  and we specifically do not require, at this early point in our work
  on cognitive-and-immersive systems, cognitive
  \emph{self}-consciousness, despite the fact that the latter is
  something that has been significantly mechanized and implemented
  \cite{roman2015_robot_self-con,sb_on_knowledge_game}.}  We now turn
to the presentation of the requisite formal and computational
machinery.
