\section{Proposed Contributions of the Dissertation}

We now lay out the novel contributions of this work:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a high-level but rigorous and fertile definition for what
  constitutes a CAIS, separating it from a physical robot.
\item Define a framework for how one approaches building a CAIS.
\item Create a real-world implementation of a CAIS, demonstrating at a
  novel level that it:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item adapts to a number of potential input mechanisms;
            \item operates at a true multi-modal and multi-user level; and
            \item is capable of interacting with and understanding
              third-party content.
        \end{enumerate}
      \item Create a formal definition of a CAIS' implementation and
        its capabilities.
      \item Utilize the above items to handle tasks of reasoning,
        planning, and plan recognition in and involving a CAIS.
\end{enumerate}
