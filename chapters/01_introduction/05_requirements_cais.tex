\section{Requirements of CAIS}\label{ref:requirements_cais}

It should be noted that a CAIS to be considered a truly ``intelligent''
room, it is not sufficient that the room be intelligent about, for
example, search queries over a domain $D$; the room should also be
intelligent about cognitive states of agents in the room and their
cognitive states towards $D$.

Despite there being a significant amount of work done in building
intelligent environments (of varying levels of intelligence;
\cite{coen_design_1998,brooks_intelligent_1997,chan_review_2008}), there
is no formalization of what constitutes an intelligent room and what
separates it from an intelligent agent.  Though \cite{coen_design_1998}
briefly differentiates an intelligent room from ubiquitous computing
based on the non-ubiquity of sensors in the former, there is not any
formal or rigorous discussion of what separates an intelligent room
from a mobile robot that roams around the room with an array of
sensors.

The requirements in question are cognitive in nature and exceed
intelligent rooms with sensors that can answer queries over simple
extensional data (e.g.\ a room that can answer financial queries such
as \textit{``Show me the number of companies with revenue over X?''}).
At a high-level, we require two conditions below hold:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{C}$ \emph{Cognitive}: A CAIS should be able to
      help agents with cognitive tasks and goals.  For instance, a
      system that simply aids in querying a domain $D$ is not
      cognitive in nature; a system that aids an agent in convincing
      another agent that some state-of-affairs holds in $D$ is
      considered cognitive. (Please see the appendix for more
      discussion of our usage of the term ``cognitive.'')
    \item $\mathcal{I}$ \emph{Immersive}:  There should
      be some attribute or property of a CAIS that is non-localized
      and distinguished from agents in the room.  Moreover, this
      property should be \textbf{common knowledge}.  (Note: this is
      not easily achievable with a physical robot, and this condition
      differentiates a CAIS from a cognitive
      agent.)\footnote{This condition may not strictly be realizable,
        but the goal is to at a minimum build systems that approach
        this ideal condition.}
\end{itemize}
