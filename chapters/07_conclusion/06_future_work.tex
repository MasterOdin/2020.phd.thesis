\section{Future Work}

We now discuss some promising avenues of future work. As stated in Chapter~\ref{chap:formalizing},
the cognitive calculus we use here, the \CEC lies towards the base of the cognitive calculi hierarchy.
This gives then the ability to look at extensions of this base, exploring different calculi to
fit other means. For example, there is the Deontic Cognitive Event Calculus (\DCEC) adds the deontic
operator of obligation, which would allow us to
