In this dissertation, we introduced the concept of \textit{cognitive and immersive systems}, and from it,
provided a definition of what constitutes such a system and from there its architecture, implementation,
and formalization. We now look back upon our planned contributions as enumerated in Section~\ref{sec:contributions},
providing some retrospective thoughts stemming from the work presented above. Afterwards, we present our
thoughts on future work that may stem from the foundational work completed here.
