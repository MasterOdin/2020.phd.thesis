In this dissertation, we introduced the concept of \textit{cognitive
and immersive systems}, and provided a definition of what constitutes
such a system.  Next, we moved to the architecture, implementation,
and formalization of such a system.  We now look back upon our planned
contributions as enumerated in Section~\ref{sec:contributions}, and
provide some retrospective thoughts pertaining to the work presented
above.  Finally, we share some thoughts regarding future work that
will be developed from the foundational work completed here.
