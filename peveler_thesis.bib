interface can converge to provide a concerted, natural user modality.
The work described herein involves the user commanding simple shapes about a large-screen graphics display surface. Because voice can be augmented with simultaneous pointing, the free usage of pronouns becomes possible, with a corresponding gain in naturalness and economy of expression. Conversely,
gesture aided by voice gains precision in its power to reference.},

	abstract = {Traditional relative pointing devices such as mice and trackpads are unsuitable for pointing at distant displays, because they encumber the users by requiring either a flat surface to operate on or being held by two hands. Past research has examined many new pointing methods, but few could surpass the speed and accuracy of mice and trackpads. This paper introduces a new pointing system that is developed based on HTC Vive, a relatively low-cost virtual reality system, and proposes two methods of combining absolute and relative pointing. The proposed methods were compared against single-mode pointing methods (i.e., pure absolute pointing and pure relative pointing) in a Fitts' law study. The results show that with only a short period of practice, one hybrid pointing technique enabled faster and more accurate pointing than both single-mode pointing techniques, which included a trackpad.},

	abstract = {We introduce Reagent, a technology that readily converts ordinary webpages containing structured data into software agents with which one can interact naturally, via a combination of speech and pointing. Previous efforts to make webpage content manipulable by third-party software components in browsers or desktop applications have generally relied upon specialized instrumentation included in the webpages -- a practice that neither scales well nor applies to pre-existing webpages. In contrast, Reagent automatically captures semantic details and semantically-meaningful mouse events from arbitrary webpages that contain no pre-existing special instrumentation. Reagent combines these events with text transcriptions of user speech to derive and execute parameterized commands representing human intent. Thus, users may request various visualization or analytic operations to be performed on data displayed on a page by speaking to it and/or pointing to elements within it. When unable to infer translations between event labels and human terminology, Reagent proactively asks users for definitions and adds them to its dictionary. We demonstrate Reagent in the context of a collection of pre-existing webpages that contain football team and player statistics.},

Input, output, and architectural variations in each interactive space introduce big overhead in terms of cost and time for developing, deploying and maintaining applications for interactive spaces. Often, these applications become on-off experience tied to the deployed spaces. To alleviate this problem and enable rapid responsive space design applications similar to responsive web design, we present CELIO application development framework for interactive spaces. The framework is micro services based and neatly decouples application and design specifications from hardware and architecture specifications of an interactive space. In this paper, we describe this framework and its implementation details. Also, we briefly discuss the use cases developed using this framework.},

	abstract = {"The Logical Reasoning with Diagrams and Sentences courseware package teaches the principles of analytical reasoning and proof construction using a carefully crafted combination of textbook, desktop, and online materials. This package is sure to be an essential resource in a range of courses incorporating logical reasoning, including formal linguistics, philosophy, mathematics, and computer science. Unlike traditional formal treatments of reasoning, this package uses both graphical and sentential representations to reflect common situations in everyday reasoning where information is expressed in many forms, such as finding your way to a location using a map and an address. It also teaches students how to construct and check the logical validity of a variety of proofs--of consequence and non-consequence, consistency and inconsistency, and independence--using an intuitive proof system which extends standard proof treatments with sentential, graphical, and heterogeneous inference rules, allowing students to focus on proof content rather than syntactic structure. Building upon the widely used Tarski's World and Language, Proof and Logic courseware packages, Logical Reasoning with Diagrams and Sentences contains more than three hundred exercises, most of which can be assessed by the Grade Grinder online assessment service; is supported by an extensive website through which students and instructors can access online video lectures by the authors; and allows instructors to create their own exercises and assess their students' work. Logical Reasoning with Diagrams and Sentences is an expanded revision of the Hyperproof courseware package"--},

This additional content, which is also known as noise, is typically not related to the main subject and may hamper the performance of web data mining, and hence needs to be removed properly. In this paper, we present Content Extraction via Text Density (CETD) a fast, accurate and general method for extracting content from diverse web pages, and using DOM (Document Object Model) node text density to preserve the original structure. For this purpose, we introduce two concepts to measure the importance of nodes: Text Density and Composite Text Density. In order to extract content intact, we propose a technique called DensitySum to replace Data Smoothing. The approach was evaluated with the CleanEval benchmark and with randomly selected pages from well-known websites, where various web domains and styles are tested. The average F1-scores with our method were 8.79\% higher than the best scores among several alternative methods.},

On the constructive side,many of the core formalisms and techniques used in AI come out of, andare indeed still much used and refined in, philosophy: first-orderlogic and its extensions; intensional logics suitable for the modelingof doxastic attitudes and deontic reasoning; inductive logic,probability theory, and probabilistic reasoning; practical reasoningand planning, and so on. In light of this, some philosophers conductAI research and development as philosophy. , In the present entry, the history of AI is briefly recounted, proposeddefinitions of the field are discussed, and an overview of the fieldis provided. In addition, both philosophical AI (AI pursued as and outof philosophy) and philosophy of AI are discussed, viaexamples of both.

Specifically, we highlight the importance of integrating higher level symbolic reasoning and intent recognition in the design of such an agent, and outline pathways towards the realization of these capabilities.

We focus in particular on the core module of the framework, a human-aware planner that generates a sequence of actions for a robot, taking into account the state of the environment and the goals of the robot, together with a set of forecasted possible plans of the human. We describe the planner and its relations to other system components like a plan recognizer, and present a series of experiments performed with a household robot in a small apartment.},

This paper motivates and formalizes two aspects of contract correctness from the perspective of the preferences of the agents participating in them. A contract is safe for a participant if participating in the contract would not leave the participant worse off than otherwise. More strongly, a contract is beneficial to a participant if participating in the contract would leave the participant better off than otherwise. This paper seeks to partially automate reasoning about the correctness of formally modeled business contracts. It represents contracts formally as a set of commitments. It motivates constraints on how cooperative agents might value the various states of commitments. Further, it shows that such constraints are consistent and promote cooperation. Lastly, it presents algorithms for checking the safety and guaranteed benefits of a contract.},

The first section of the book introduces the logicist approach to AI-discussing the representation of declarative knowledge and featuring an introduction to the process of conceptualization, the syntax and semantics of predicate calculus, and the basics of other declarative representations such as frames and semantic nets. This section also provides a simple but powerful inference procedure, resolution, and shows how it can be used in a reasoning system. The next several chapters discuss nonmonotonic reasoning, induction, and reasoning under uncertainty, broadening the logical approach to deal with the inadequacies of strict logical deduction. The third section introduces modal operators that facilitate representing and reasoning about knowledge. This section also develops the process of writing predicate calculus sentences to the metalevel-to permit sentences about sentences and about reasoning processes. The final three chapters discuss the representation of knowledge about states and actions, planning, and intelligent system architecture. End-of-chapter bibliographic and historical comments provide background and point to other works of interest and research. Each chapter also contains numerous student exercises (with solutions provided in an appendix) to reinforce concepts and challenge the learner.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10726},
	abstract = {We present a new system S for handling uncertainty in a quantified modal logic (first-order modal logic). The system is based on both probability theory and proof theory. The system is derived from Chisholm's epistemology. We concretize Chisholm's system by grounding his undefined and primitive (i.e. foundational) concept of reasonablenes in probability and proof theory. S can be useful in systems that have to interact with humans and provide justifications for their uncertainty. As a demonstration of the system, we apply the system to provide a solution to the lottery paradox. Another advantage of the system is that it can be used to provide uncertainty values for counterfactual statements. Counterfactuals are statements that an agent knows for sure are false. Among other cases, counterfactuals are useful when systems have to explain their actions to users. Uncertainties for counterfactuals fall out naturally from our system. Efficient reasoning in just simple first-order logic is a hard problem. Resolution-based first-order reasoning systems have made significant progress over the last several decades in building systems that have solved non-trivial tasks (even unsolved conjectures in mathematics). We present a sketch of a novel algorithm for reasoning that extends first-order resolution. Finally, while there have been many systems of uncertainty for propositional logics, first-order logics and propositional modal logics, there has been very little work in building systems of uncertainty for first-order modal logics. The work described below is in progress; and once finished will address this lack.},

Arguably,‘believes, ‘hopes’, and ‘knows’ arepropositional attitude verb and, when followed by a clause thatincludes a full sentence expressing a proposition (athat-clause) form propositional attitude reporting sentences.Attributions of cognitive relations to propositions can also takeother forms. For example, ‘Jack believes what Jill said’and ‘Jack believes everything Jill believes’ are bothpropositional attitude ascriptions, even though the attitude verb isnot followed by a that-clause. Some philosophers and linguists alsoclaim that sentences like ‘Jill wanted Jack to fall’,‘Jack and Jill are seeking water’, and ‘Jack fearsJill’, for example, are to be analyzed as propositional attitudeascribing sentences, the first saying, perhaps, something to theeffect that Jill wants that Jack falls, the second that Jackand Jill strive that they find water, and the third that Jackfears that Jill will hurt him. But such analyses arecontroversial. (See the entry on intensional transitive verbs.), Having a successful theory of propositional attitude reports isimportant, as they serve as a converging point for a number ofdifferent fields, including philosophy of language, natural languagesemantics, philosophy of mind, metaphysics, and epistemology., In this article, we examine attempts to deal with a puzzle aboutpropositional attitude reporting sentences that was first posed byGottlob Frege in his 1892. Subsequent literature has been concernedwith developing a semantic theory that offers an adequate treatment ofthis puzzle.

Instead, I have attempted here to describe fundamental AI ideas that underlie many of these applications. My organization of these ideas is not, then, based on the subject matter of their application, but is, instead, based on general computational concepts involving the kinds of data structures used, the types of operations performed on these data struc­ tures, and the properties of con'trol strategies used by AI systems. I stress, in particular, the important roles played in AI by generalized production systems and the predicate calculus. The notes on which the book is based evolved in courses and seminars at Stanford University and at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Although certain topics treated in my previous book, Problem­ solving Methods in Artificial Intelligence, are covered here as well, this book contains many additional topics such as rule-based systems, robot problem-solving systems, and structured-object representations.},

	abstract = {Proof-theoretic semantics is an alternative to truth-conditionsemantics. It is based on the fundamental assumption that the centralnotion in terms of which meanings are assigned to certain expressionsof our language, in particular to logical constants, is that ofproof rather than truth. In this senseproof-theoretic semantics is semantics in terms of proof .Proof-theoretic semantics also means the semantics of proofs,i.e., the semantics of entities which describe how we arrive at certainassertions given certain assumptions. Both aspects of proof-theoreticsemantics can be intertwined, i.e. the semantics of proofs is itselfoften given in terms of proofs., Proof-theoretic semantics has several roots, the most specific onebeing Gentzen’s remarks that the introduction rules in hiscalculus of natural deduction define the meanings of logical constants,while the elimination rules can be obtained as a consequence of thisdefinition (see section 2.2.1). Morebroadly, it belongs to what Prawitz called general prooftheory (see section 1.1). Even morebroadly, it is part of the tradition according to which the meaning ofa term should be explained by reference to the way it is usedin our language., Within philosophy, proof-theoretic semantics has mostly figuredunder the heading “theory of meaning”. This terminologyfollows Dummett, who claimed that the theory of meaning is the basis oftheoretical philosophy, a view which he attributed to Frege. The term“proof-theoretic semantics” was proposed bySchroeder-Heister (1991; used already in 1987 lectures in Stockholm) in order not to leave the term“semantics” to denotationalism alone—after all,“semantics” is the standard term for investigations dealingwith the meaning of linguistic expressions. Furthermore, unlike“theory of meaning”, the term “proof-theoreticsemantics” covers philosophical and technical aspects likewise.In 1999, the first conference with this title took place inTübingen, the second one in 2013.

In this paper, we ask the question what role automated decision-making technologies can play in the deliberative process of the human decision maker.Specifically, we focus on expert humans in the loop who now share a detailed, if not complete, model of the domain with the assistant, but may still be unable to compute plans due to cognitive overload. To this end, we propose a PDS framework RADAR based on research in the automated planning community that aids the human decision maker in constructing plans. We will situate our discussion on principles of interface design laid out in the literature on the degrees of automation and its effect on the collaborative decision-making process.  Also, at the heart of our design is the principle of  naturalistic decision making  which has been shown to be a necessary requirement of such systems, thus focusing more on providing suggestions rather than enforcing decisions and executing actions. We will demonstrate the different properties of such a system through examples in a fire-fighting domain, where human commanders are involved in building response strategies to mitigate a fire outbreak.The paper is written to serve both as a position paper by motivating requirements of an effective proactive decision support system, and also an emerging application of these ideas in the context of the role of an automated planner in human decision making, in a platform that can prove to be a valuable test bed for research on the same.},

	abstract = {In many real world planning scenarios, agents often do not have enough resources to achieve all of their goals. Consequently, they are forced to find plans that satisfy only a subset of the goals. Solving such partial satisfaction planning (PSP) problems poses several challenges, including an increased emphasis on modeling and handling plan quality (in terms of action costs and goal utilities). Despite the ubiquity of such PSP problems, very little attention has been paid to them in the planning community. In this paper, we start by describing a spectrum of PSP problems and focus on one of the more general PSP problems, termed PSP NET BENEFIT. We develop three techniques, (i) one based on integer programming, called OptiPlan, (ii) the second based on regression planning with reachability heuristics, called AltAltps, and (iii) the third based on anytime heuristic search for a forward state-space heuristic planner, called Sapaps. Our empirical studies with these planners show that the heuristic planners generate plans that are comparable to the quality of plans generated by OptiPlan, while incurring only a small fraction of the cost.},

With this exciting new edition, the coverage of multi-agents is completely updated to include several areas that have come to prominence in the last several years, including auctions, computational social choice, and markov decision processes. In turn, a variety of topics that were initially considered critical have dwindled in importance, so the coverage of that subject matter is decreased with this new edition. The result of this redefined balance of coverage is a timely and essential resource on a popular topic.  Introduces you to the concept of agents and multi-agent systems and the main applications for which they are appropriate Discusses the main issues surrounding the design of intelligent agents and a multi-agent society Delves into a number of typical applications for agent technology Addresses deductive reasoning agents, practical reasoning agents, reactive and hybrid agents, and more Reviews multi-agent decision making, communication and cooperation, and intelligent autonomous agents  By the end of the book, you will have a firm grasp on how agents are distinct from other software paradigms and understand the characteristics of applications that lend themselves to agent-oriented software.},

The Cognitive and Immersive Room (CIR) is developed as an immersive Chinese restaurant to teach Mandarin, but the interaction challenges and solutions can be reasonably generalized to other languages taught using similar techniques. As users interact with the immersive environment and the virtual AI agent, they face several user interaction challenges. These challenges arise from new learners' lack of proficiency in the foreign language. By studying user interactions in the CIR, we were able to articulate some of the interaction challenges. We have enhanced the AI agent, virtual environment, and the on-boarding process for new users to mitigate these challenges.

These are: utilizing the images captured by multiple fixed cameras located in the room and handling possible registration errors due to the low resolution of the aquired face images. In addition, we also provide comparisons between frame-based and video-based face recognition and analyze the effect of frame weighting. Experimental results obtained on the CHIL database, which has been collected from different smart rooms, show that benefiting from multi-view video data and handling registration errors reduce the false identification rates significantly.},

STUDY DESIGN: Blinded experimental simulator-based study.
METHODS: There were 15 candidates divided into a novice (≤50 procedures performed) or experienced ({\textgreater}50 procedures) group depending on their previous microlaryngoscopy experience. Each candidate undertook a 10-minute simulation of a microlaryngoscopy and excision biopsy, and two blinded experts rated their performance live on each of the two assessment tools. To assess face validity, each candidate subsequently completed a questionnaire about the simulator.
RESULTS: The model demonstrated good face validity across all levels of experience. The global rating assessment demonstrated excellent interrater reliability (0.9) compared to the checklist assessment (0.7). The checklist assessment was able to differentiate experienced and novice candidates and therefore demonstrated construct validity. The global rating tool, however, was unable to differentiate candidates. There was a significant correlation between the two assessment tools (correlation coefficient = 0.624).
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first reported study of a high-fidelity microlaryngoscopy simulator with task-specific rating tools. Use of these tools is recommended within otolaryngology training programs, with the global rating assessment for use as a frequently used feedback tool, and the checklist assessment as a confirmatory evaluation of competency at transitions of professional training.},

	abstract = {Recent work on plan recognition as planning has shown great promise in the use of a domain theory and general planning algorithms for the plan recognition problem. In this paper, we propose to extend previous work to (1) address observations over fluents, (2) better address unreliable observations (i.e., noisy or missing observations), and (3) recognize plans in addition to goals. To this end, we introduce a relaxation of the plan-recognition-as-planning formulation that allows unreliable observations. That is, in addition to the original costs of the plan, we define two objectives that account for missing and noisy observations, and optimize for a linear combination of all objectives. We approximate the posterior probabilities of generated plans by taking into account the combined costs that include penalties for missing or noisy observations, and normalizing over a sample set of plans generated by finding either diverse or high-quality plans. Our experiments show that this approach improves goal recognition in most domains when observations are unreliable. In addition, we evaluate plan recognition performance and show that the high-quality plan generation approach should be preferred in most domains.},

	abstract = {Imagining the future helps anticipate and prepare for what is coming. This has great importance to many, if not all, human endeavors. In this paper, we develop the Planning Projector system prototype, which applies plan-recognition-as-planning technique to both explain the observations derived from analyzing relevant news and social media, and project a range of possible future state trajectories for human review. Unlike the plan recognition problem, where a set of goals, and often a plan library must be given as part of the input, the Planning Projector system takes as input the domain knowledge, a sequence of observations derived from the news, a time horizon, and the number of trajectories to produce. It then computes the set of trajectories by applying a planner capable of finding a set of high-quality plans on a transformed planning problem. The Planning Projector prototype integrates several components including: (1) knowledge engineering: the process of encoding the domain knowledge from domain experts; (2) data transformation: the problem of analyzing and transforming the raw data into a sequence of observations; (3) trajectory computation: characterizing the future state projection problem and computing a set of trajectories; (4) user interface: clustering and visualizing the trajectories. We evaluate our approach qualitatively and conclude that the Planning Projector helps users understand future possibilities so that they can make more informed decisions.},

Scenario planning for risk management puts an added emphasis on identifying and managing emerging risk. While a variety of methods have been proposed for this purpose, we show that applying AI planning techniques to devise possible scenarios provides a unique advantage for scenario planning. Our system, the Scenario Planning Advisor (SPA), takes as input the relevant information from news and social media, representing key risk drivers, as well as the domain knowledge and generates scenarios that explain the key risk drivers and describe the alternative futures. To this end, we provide a characterization of the problem, knowledge engineering methodology, and transformation to planning. Furthermore, we describe the computation of the scenarios, lessons learned, and the feedback received from the pilot deployment of the SPA system in IBM.},

The case studies are designed to give analysts-in-training a hands-on opportunity to apply structured analytic techniques to tackle real-life problems. Each case delivers a compelling narrative and a set of step-by-step instructions that make teaching and learning as effective and efficient as possible.Key Features: Questions at the start of each case challenge the student to think critically and help the students bring the case into focus;Carefully crafted narratives provide the right amount of detail to give a realistic sense of the complexity and challenges of the case;Recommended readings at the end of each narrative allow room for further researchSections entitled "Structured Analytic Techniques in Action" frame the analytic tasks and provide step-by-step instructions for applying three to fi ve analytic techniques in a series of exercises for each case study;Two hundred photos, maps, figures, tables, boxes, and technique templates support analysis and instruction; andA matrix of the cases and techniques used in each cases augment the annotated table of contents and provide students and instructors an all-in-one view of the contents.Praise for Cases in Intelligence Analysis:  Structured Analytic Techniques in Action:"Cases in Intelligence Analysis takes an innovative approach to intelligence analysis that helps the reader to develop a more thorough and disciplined analytic process. The authors contend that the use of compelling and historically accurate cases, coupled with an impressive toolkit of analytic techniques, can help us all to move beyond flawed analyses. I think they are right."--Charles S. Robb, Co-Chairman of The Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction"This work confronts head-on the problem of cognitive traps that history has shown to be the fundamental factor in most intelligence failures. After reviewing this presentation of methods and case examples, professional practitioners can sharpen their skills by testing the methods on their own problems--those they have experienced in the past and those they are confronting at present."--Douglas MacEachin, Former CIA/Deputy Director of Intelligence"Structured analytic techniques are increasingly being adopted by government intelligence analysts, but they are just as useful to the private sector. The value of this fascinating case study book is that it provides the growing array of users with practical advice on how best to apply the techniques to the challenges they deal with every day."--Gordon S.

'Quickies' enrich the experience of using sticky notes by allowing them to be tracked and managed more effectively. Quickies are stickies that have intelligence and the ability to remind us about the task we ought to perform or to provide us at the right time with the information we captured in the past. The project explores how the use of Artificial Intelligence, RFID, and ink recognition technologies can make it possible to create intelligent sticky notes that can be searched, located, can send reminders and messages, and more broadly, can help us to seamlessly connect our physical and digital experiences.},

	abstract = {Dialogue systems have many applications such as customer support or question answering. Typically they have been limited to shallow single turn interactions. However more advanced applications such as career coaching or planning a trip require a much more complex multi-turn dialogue. Current limitations of conversational systems have made it difficult to support applications that require personalization, customization and context dependent interactions. We tackle this challenging problem by using domain-independent AI planning to automatically create dialogue plans, customized to guide a dialogue towards achieving a given goal. The input includes a library of atomic dialogue actions, an initial state of the dialogue, and a goal. Dialogue plans are plugged into a dialogue system capable to orchestrate their execution. Use cases demonstrate the viability of the approach. Our work on dialogue planning has been integrated into a product, and it is in the process of being deployed into another.},

	abstract = {Current existing chatbot engines do not properly handle a group chat with many users and many chatbots. This prevents chatbots from developing their full potential as social participants. This happens because there is a lack of methods and tools to design and engineer conversation rules. The work presented in this paper has two major contributions: the presentation of a Finite-State-Automata-based DSL (Domain Specific Language), called DSL-CR, for engineering multi-party conversation rules for inter-message coherence to be used by chatbot engines; and its usage in a real-world dialogue problem with four bots and humans. With this tool, the amount of domain and programming expertise needed for creating conversation rules is reduced, and a larger group of people, like linguists, can specify the conversation rules.},
